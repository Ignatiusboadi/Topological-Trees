# Topological-Trees
Codes to generate topological trees.

A simple graph is a set of vertices V(G) and a set of edges E(G) which are 2-element subsets of V. A path graph is defined as an alternating sequence of distinct vertices and edges v_(1), {v_(1), v_(2)}, v_(2), {v_(2), v_(3)}, v_(3), ... , v_(n-1), {v_(n-1), v_(n)}, v_(n). Any two vertices in a tree are connected by a unique path. A graph G is said to be connected if there is a path between any two of its vertices. A simple Graph T is called a tree if it is connected and acyclic.

When a vertex of a tree is designated as the root, we have a rooted tree. This imposes a heirarchical structure on the the tree and hence the root can be draw at the top of the tree.

A Topological tree is a rooted tree with no vertex of outdegree one (or degree two, except possibly the root). They are also referred to as series-reduced or homeomorphically irreducible trees. By definition, the tree that has only one vertex is a topological tree.
